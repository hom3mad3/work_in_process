            <div class="about">
            
            <p>“Work in Process” is a collection of conversations with 16 European self-employed designers. 
            
            <p>For her Master Thesis in product design at Karlsruhe University of Arts and Design, Lauren Walter spoke to designers who work on furniture and home accessories, to hear about events and occurrences that coined their careers. </p> <p>The portraits paint images of the persons behind their body of work. Of their motivations, their way of working and thinking and certain character traits. The comments are filled with stories and experiences. They reflect an honest answer to their design practice yet they are not to dictate any dogmatic advice.
            </p>
            
            <p>
Luckily, communicating with them has also proven how important it is to have the right attitude so as to be able to succeed in one's job. They have found ways to solve both problems in the field of furniture but also the ones facing them when it comes to their vocation. Being a designer is not a job you leave behind when you go home. It's a work in process.</p>

In his work he combines many disciplines: he painted graffiti for several years, studied art, cabinet making, interior architecture and design. Being of Swedish and Chilean heritage, his work is made up of contrasts just as intriguing. It embodies the clean and polished Scandinavian as well as the colorful South American influences while constantly challenging the boundaries between design and art.</p>

    <p>Piet Hein Eek graduated from the Design Academy Eindhoven in 1990 and then opened a studio with his business partner Nob Ruijgrok. The studio based in Eindhoven produces one-offs and products for the industry all marked with the designer's unique way to incorporate experimental material approaches into mass-produceable items. Today, the studio space is more than 10,000 square meters in size, including a workshop, an office space, a shop for selling many of the objects produced, an event space and a restaurant. The following text was not collected in an interview but a statement Piet Hein Eek submitted.</p>

<h2>Instead of working purely as a designer, we started producing, distributing and even selling our own products.</h2>
